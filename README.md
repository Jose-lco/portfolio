This is a repository with my personal contacts and a little information about me.
It includes 3 files i.e the home/about me page, the portfolio and the contact page.
there is a navbar that is consistent throughout all pages and is responsive to the size of the viewport.
the about me contains two rows, the first with the heading about me and the second row has an avatar of me and some background information of how i ended up in software engineering.
the portfolio page has no information for now because i am yet to create any content that i can attach to my name.
the contact page has two rows the first contains a heading and the second one is divided into two columns; a table with my actual email address in case anyone wants to contact me.
